# YouTube - Mouseover Preview
Uses YouTube's storyboard to show preview images when hovering a video's thumbnail. Hold shift while clicking to jump to the time shown in the preview image.

## Installation
You need to have a UserScript extension (e.g. Tampermonkey for Chrome, Greasemonkey for Firefox) installed to run this script.

[Install this UserScript](https://github.com/LenAnderson/YouTube-Mouseover-Preview/raw/master/youtube_mouseover_preview.user.js)

YouTube's inline playback feature interferes with this script. To disable this feature go to **Settings** > **Playback and performance** and disable **Inline playback**.
